Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For the project shown we were given the scenario that we were recent graduates and were looking into working at a tech company. At this company, during the interview, we were asked to audition and write a code for their website. Due to the company having international clients, they would like a more inclusive website that has both a 12-hour and a 24-hour clock.  
What did you do particularly well?
The program that I submitted was written well and accomplished almost all of the requirements. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
There was a couple of places where my code could have been advanced. First of all, my clocks did not display side by side like they were supposed too. I also had issues with the time 11:59:59 to 12:00:00 was coming out as 12:0:0 which is incorrect. If I corrected these two things my code would have been more efficient.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found it most difficult to ensure that the clocks were displaying different times but still the same time. I mainly overcame this issue, but I did not because I still had an error with 12:0:0.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills that I will be able to take from this project is the ability to make a clock through code. Even if it's in a different coding language, it will still be similar or at least recognizable to this project.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable by creating a flowchart beforehand to ensure my project stayed in order. I took the flowchart and adapted that to code.
